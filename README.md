#Quick history
The main objective for this theme was to make discord better-looking with a lot of options customizable.
We now have a theme that support +50 options for backgrounds of each element, colors, custom icons & texts and an rgb animation.
There are even some addons for this theme like replacing the server position to stick it on top of the window, replacing the server folders icons by letters,
Making the the members list hoverrable and disabling the offline round and ugly statuses.
